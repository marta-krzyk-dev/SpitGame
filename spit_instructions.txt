Setup
Place five cards face down in a row. Add a second card to piles two through five. Add a third card to piles three through five. Add a fourth card to piles four and five. Add a fifth card to pile five. Flip the top card in each pile face up. The remaining cards in your hand are known as your spit pile.

Objective
The objective of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all his/her cards.

Game Play
The game begins with each player playing the top card of his/her spit pile face up into the middle. Players then can move cards from the five piles in front of them in three ways.

(1) Move cards into the middle with one rank higher or one rank lower than the card showing in the middle. Note that the ace will link the 2s and kings together.
(2) If one of the player's five piles is gone, a player can move a card to the empty space.
(3) Cards with the same rank can be stacked on top of each other within the five piles. For example, a 5 can be played on another 5 within a player’s piles.

When neither player can play a card into the middle, each player will flip another card onto the middle piles from his/her spit pile.

Once a player has played all the cards from his/her five piles, each player will slap a pile to take. Players should try to slap the smaller of the two piles because the goal of the game is to get rid of your cards. The pile slapped is shuffled with the player’s remaining spit pile. A new round is setup.

A player with less than 15 cards will not be able to complete the setup of 5 piles. The piles should be setup as far as the cards allow.

A player with 15 or fewer cards will not have a spit pile. In this case, there will only be one middle pile. The loser of the round will take the middle pile. If the winning player of the round has no cards left, he/she wins the game.
